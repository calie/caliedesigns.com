                    <p>After an acquisition of 2 competing marketing automation companies there was a need to unify 
                        products into one 
                        experience that felt seamless as the user switched from one to the other.</p>
                    <p>We faced many challenges including different tech stacks, multiple design systems or no design system within 
                        existing projects and hundreds of pages with minimal usage.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Much of the research for this project was in determining the scope of the unification efforts and focusing on the work that
                    would create the most impact. To start, we took inventory of what
                    pages currently existed - what kind of controls did they have and does that pattern match up with what we see in the other 
                    products. On the <em>quantitatilve</em> side we did a deep dive into usage stats. This was an opportunity to remove any unused features and an easy way
                    to prioritize the redsign efforts to features with the most traffic.</p>
                <p>Some <em>qualitative</em> reseach was done up front by interviewing users to determine frustrations that they had with each product. When redesigning key components we took these
                    concerns into account to improve usability across the board.

                <p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, ‘Which way? Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake

                    <h3>Implementation</h3>
                    <p>Determining the tech stack for the new unified experience going forward was vital
                        to our success. We evaluated VueJS and ReactJS and decided to build the new design
                        system in React. Because there were hundreds of pages between all of the projects,
                        my team built an intricate iframe system in order to be able to render all pages
                        from different origin platforms into the same UI.</p>
                    <p>To get started, I wrote a CSS-only style guide to bring the systems closer together
                        through fonts, colors and visual style and created basic patterns in Figma to get us started. This was a quick update that would allow us
                        to change out components as they were built in an iterative way.</p>
                    <p>As the component library evolved, engineering teams throughout the company were able 
                        to utilize the new React components to start updating their pages in a consistent
                        fashion while the design team created a matching design system in Figma.

                <h3>After Unification</h3>
                <p>Below are the resulting visual designs. To measure the success of the project we used the Systems Usability Scale (SUS) to quantify usability of the products before and after the redesign.
